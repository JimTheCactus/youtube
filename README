YouTube URI Lookup Irssi Bot - It's better than your mama's vacuum!

Parses Youtube URIs and uses Youtube's Data API (http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html) to output the link info to the channel.

Put the script in your Irssi scripts folder, run it and it just works. Tested in Perl 5.10.
