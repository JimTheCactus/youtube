Youtube Title Lookup Irssi Script

Parses Youtube links and outputs the title of the video to the channel window.

Put the script in your Irssi scripts folder, run it and it just works.

I just made a small update to add support for youtu.be-links, but since I couldn't find the script hosted anywhere online I decided to put it up on github. Thanks to the original author tuqs!
